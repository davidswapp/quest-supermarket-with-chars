 All I can see is pizza. Maybe we should just buy a bunch of frozen pizzas and serve them instead. 
Same. Let’s just get a few pizzas so that we can have something before the event. What time does the event start again? 
Definitely. Anyway, the eggs. How difficult can it be to put the eggs on display? And where is the staff in this place? Can’t even ask for help. Guess we should have a look in the dry food aisle, that’s where they keep a lot of baking stuff.
