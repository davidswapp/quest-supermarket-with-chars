There is a lot of stuff on offer here. Maybe they sell bigger packs of eggs on discount here. 
I don’t think Alex would be happy about that, we promised we’d make the cakes. Maybe we could get a few though, I’m feeling pretty hungry already. 
I think around 8PM… So in about four hours. We’ll definitely need to eat before that. And since the event is in the middle of the forest, there won’t be any shops nearby. And we can’t eat any of the food that’s reserved for the guests anyway, so that’s a solid idea.
