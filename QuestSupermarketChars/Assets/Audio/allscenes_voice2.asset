  transcript: "Twelve? Are you sure? How many cakes do we need?\r\nOh okay, well
    at least we have time.\r\nWe still have a few hours, baking cakes dozen take
    THAT long.\r\nWe should hurry a bit though\u2026 This is the only supermarket
    in the area but I\u2019ve never been here. Have you?\r\nShould and be that difficult,
    they are usually close to baking stuff right?\r\nYeah lets grab a few bottles
    of milk. And maybe some cream? I thought we needed some with the strawberries.\r\nAre
    eggs even kept in the fridge? My flat mate always leaves them on the kitchen
    counter\u2026 To be honest he leaves everything on the kitchen counter so it\u2019s
    not really a trustworthy reference. I dolt think the eggs are here though. \r\nAll
    I can see is pizza. Maybe we should just buy a bunch of frozen pizza and serve
    them instead. \r\nSame. Lets just get a few pizza so that we can have something
    before the event. What time does the event start again? \r\nDefinitely. Anyway,
    the eggs. How difficult can it be to put eggs on display? And where is the staff
    in this place? Canned even ask for help. Guess we should have a look in the dry
    food aisle, that where they keep a lot of baking stuff. \r\nYeah who designed
    this place? Theirs no navigation signs either, it\u2019s impossible to find anything
    here. Well I guess weave got milk and pizza. \r\nYeah actually that a good idea.
    We really need to get going, since the drive there takes ages. And I still canned
    see any eggs!\r\nI mean probably, but we want have time to wait for chickens
    to lay eggs, the drive there takes an hour too.\r\nYeah that seems like our best
    bet at the moment. I\u2019m sure nobody will notice! Lets grab everything we
    need and hurry up!\r\n"
