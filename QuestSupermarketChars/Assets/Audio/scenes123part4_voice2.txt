Twelve Are you sure How many cakes do we need
Oh okay well at least we have time
We still have a few hours baking cakes doesnt take that long
We should hurry a bit though This is the only supermarket in the area but Ive never been here Have you
Shouldnt be that difficult they are usually close to baking stuff right
Yeah lets grab a few bottles of milk And maybe some cream I thought we needed some with the strawberries
Are eggs even kept in the fridge My flatmate always leaves them on the kitchen counterâ€¦ To be honest he leaves everything on the kitchen counter so its not really a trustworthy reference I dont think the eggs are here though 
All I can see is pizza Maybe we should just buy a bunch of frozen pizzas and serve them instead 
Same Lets just get a few pizzas so that we can have something before the event What time does the event start again 
Definitely Anyway the eggs How difficult can it be to put eggs on display And where is the staff in this place Cant even ask for help Guess we should have a look in the dry food aisle thats where they keep a lot of baking stuff 
Yeah who designed this place Theres no navigation signs either its impossible to find anything here Well I guess weve got milk and pizza 
Yeah actually thats a good idea We really need to get going since the drive there takes ages And I still cant see any eggs
