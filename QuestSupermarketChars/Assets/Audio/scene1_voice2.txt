Twelve? Are you sure? How many cakes do we need?
Oh okay, well at least we have time.
We still have a few hours, baking cakes doesn’t take THAT long.
We should hurry a bit though… This is the only supermarket in the area but I’ve never been here. Have you?
Shouldn’t be that difficult, they are usually close to baking stuff right?
