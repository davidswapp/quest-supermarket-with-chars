Right so, Alex said we need to find twelve eggs.
I think about sixty people are coming, so we need to bake at least six I think.
I mean it’s tonight so we really don’t have much time.
No, I hope they haven’t hidden the eggs like some shops do.
Yeah they should be around here I think.
We should probably grab some milk too right? 
Yeah good idea. Can you see the eggs anywhere? Maybe near the butter...
There is a lot of stuff on offer here. Maybe they sell bigger packs of eggs on discount here. 
I don’t think Alex would be happy about that, we promised we’d make the cakes. Maybe we could get a few though, I’m feeling pretty hungry already. 
I think around 8PM… So in about four hours. We’ll definitely need to eat before that. And since the event is in the middle of the forest, there won’t be any shops nearby. And we can’t eat any of the food that’s reserved for the guests anyway, so that’s a solid idea.
Wait there is just more cheese here? How many cheese aisles can you have in a supermarket? Aren’t they usually just in one place. 
Maybe we should just buy some cake mix so we don’t need eggs? Surely people won’t be able to tell whether it’s a mix or whether we’ve baked it ourselves.
Maybe there is a farm somewhere in the forest… 
Yeah you’re right. You know what. Let’s just grab some cake mix, maybe some cookies. We’ve got cream and milk, and don’t you just mix water with the cake mix? Isabella is bringing loads of strawberries, so we can just put a bunch of cream and strawberries on top and nobody will be able to tell.
