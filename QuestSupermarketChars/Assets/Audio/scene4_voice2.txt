Yeah who designed this place? There’s no navigation signs either, it’s impossible to find anything here. Well I guess we’ve got milk and pizza. 
Yeah actually that’s a good idea. We really need to get going, since the drive there takes ages. And I still can’t see any eggs!
I mean probably, but we won’t have time to wait for chickens to lay eggs, the drive there takes an hour too.
Yeah that seems like our best bet at the moment. I’m sure nobody will notice! Let’s grab everything we need and hurry up!
