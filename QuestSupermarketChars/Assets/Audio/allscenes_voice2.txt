Twelve? Are you sure? How many cakes do we need?
Oh okay, well at least we have time.
We still have a few hours, baking cakes dozen take THAT long.
We should hurry a bit though… This is the only supermarket in the area but If never been here. Have you?
Should and be that difficult, they are usually close to baking stuff right?
Yeah lets grab a few bottles of milk. And maybe some cream? I thought we needed some with the strawberries.
Are eggs even kept in the fridge? My flat mate always leaves them on the kitchen counter… To be honest he leaves everything on the kitchen counter so its not really a trustworthy reference. I dolt think the eggs are here though. 
All I can see is pizza. Maybe we should just buy a bunch of frozen pizza and serve them instead. 
Same. Lets just get a few pizza so that we can have something before the event. What time does the event start again? 
Definitely. Anyway, the eggs. How difficult can it be to put eggs on display? And where is the staff in this place? Canned even ask for help. Guess we should have a look in the dry food aisle, that where they keep a lot of baking stuff. 
Yeah who designed this place? Theirs no navigation signs either, its impossible to find anything here. Well I guess weave got milk and pizza. 
Yeah actually that a good idea. We really need to get going, since the drive there takes ages. And I still canned see any eggs!
I mean probably, but we want have time to wait for chickens to lay eggs, the drive there takes an hour too.
Yeah that seems like our best bet at the moment. Aim sure nobody will notice! Lets grab everything we need and hurry up!
