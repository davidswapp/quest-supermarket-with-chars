Twelve? Are you sure? How many cakes do we need?
Oh okay, well at least we have time.
We still have a few hours, baking cakes doesn’t take THAT long.
We should hurry a bit though… This is the only supermarket in the area but I’ve never been here. Have you?
Shouldn’t be that difficult, they are usually close to baking stuff right?
Yeah let’s grab a few bottles of milk. And maybe some cream? I thought we needed some with the strawberries.
Are eggs even kept in the fridge? My flatmate always leaves them on the kitchen counter… To be honest he leaves everything on the kitchen counter so it’s not really a trustworthy reference. I don’t think the eggs are here though. 
All I can see is pizza. Maybe we should just buy a bunch of frozen pizzas and serve them instead. 
Same. Let’s just get a few pizzas so that we can have something before the event. What time does the event start again? 
Definitely. Anyway, the eggs. How difficult can it be to put eggs on display? And where is the staff in this place? Can’t even ask for help. Guess we should have a look in the dry food aisle, that’s where they keep a lot of baking stuff.
